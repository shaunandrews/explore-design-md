# Design System: Airbnb

## Overview

Airbnb is the canonical example of a generous, photography-led consumer marketplace. The base canvas is pure white (`{colors.canvas}` - `#ffffff`) with deep near-black ink (`{colors.ink}` - `#222222`) for headlines and body, and a single voltage of Rausch (`{colors.primary}` - `#ff385c`) carrying every primary CTA, the search-button orb, the heart save state, and inline brand links. There is no secondary brand color in mainline marketing. The Luxe purple (`{colors.luxe}` - `#460479`) and Plus magenta (`{colors.plus}` - `#92174d`) tokens are sub-brand accents that only appear inside Airbnb Luxe / Plus contexts.

Type runs Airbnb Cereal VF, with Circular as the historic in-house fallback and a system stack underneath. Cereal sits at modest weights: display headlines render at 22-28px in weight 500-600, not the heavy 700+ weights that financial or enterprise systems lean on. The homepage hero h1 ("Inspiration for future getaways") is just 28px / 700, which would feel small on a typical SaaS page. Here it works because the layout leans on photography, city collages, and property cards for visual weight rather than typographic muscle.

The shape language is soft. Buttons are 8px radius (`{rounded.sm}`), property cards are about 14px (`{rounded.md}`), the search bar is fully pill-shaped (`{rounded.full}`), wishlist hearts and search orbs are circles (`{rounded.full}`), and category strip rounded corners run at 32px (`{rounded.xl}`). There is essentially no hard corner anywhere except the body grid itself. Every interactive element is rounded.

**Key Characteristics:**

- Single accent color: `{colors.primary}` (`#ff385c`, Rausch) carries every primary CTA, the search orb, the heart save state, and the brand wordmark. Use it scarcely. Most pages are 90% white plus ink with one or two Rausch moments.
- Custom variable type: `Airbnb Cereal VF`. Display weights sit at 500-700, body at 400. Modest weight is intentional because the system trusts photography for visual heft.
- Three-product top nav: Homes, Experiences, Services, each with a hand-illustrated 32px icon and "NEW" badges (`{component.new-tag}`) on the newer products. Active tab uses an underline rule (`{component.product-tab-active}`).
- Pill-shaped global search bar: white surface, fully rounded (`{rounded.full}`), divided by 1px hairlines into Where / When / Who segments, terminated by a circular Rausch search orb (`{component.search-orb}`).
- Property cards are photo-first: aspect-ratio rectangles with `{rounded.md}` corner clipping, swipeable image carousel, "Guest favorite" floating badge top-left, heart icon top-right, then 4-5 lines of meta beneath.
- Editorial dropdowns are clean text columns over the white canvas, with no card surface and no shadow.
- Elevation caps at one shadow tier: `rgba(0,0,0,0.02) 0 0 0 1px, rgba(0,0,0,0.04) 0 2px 6px, rgba(0,0,0,0.1) 0 4px 8px`. Use it on hover-floated cards and search/account dropdowns.
- 8px base spacing system, with major sections at `{spacing.section}` (64px). It is generous but not so airy that marketplace density is lost.

## Colors

### Brand & Accent

- **Rausch** (`{colors.primary}` - `#ff385c`): The single brand color. Use for primary CTA backgrounds, the search orb, the heart save state on property cards, and inline brand links.
- **Rausch Active** (`{colors.primary-active}` - `#e00b41`): Press / pointer-down variant.
- **Rausch Disabled** (`{colors.primary-disabled}` - `#ffd1da`): Pale tint for disabled CTAs.
- **Luxe Purple** (`{colors.luxe}` - `#460479`): Sub-brand accent for Airbnb Luxe. Only use inside Luxe-branded surfaces.
- **Plus Magenta** (`{colors.plus}` - `#92174d`): Sub-brand accent for Airbnb Plus. Same scoping as Luxe.

### Surface

- **Canvas** (`{colors.canvas}` - `#ffffff`): Default page floor for every public page. Airbnb does not have a dark mode on the public web.
- **Surface Soft** (`{colors.surface-soft}` - `#f7f7f7`): Lightest fill, used on disabled fields, sub-nav hover backgrounds, and inline search filter bands.
- **Surface Strong** (`{colors.surface-strong}` - `#f2f2f2`): Slightly heavier fill, used for circular icon-button surfaces.

### Hairlines & Borders

- **Hairline** (`{colors.hairline}` - `#dddddd`): Default 1px border tone for search bar dividers, separators, footer splits, and card borders.
- **Hairline Soft** (`{colors.hairline-soft}` - `#ebebeb`): Lighter divider for long-scrolling editorial body separators.
- **Border Strong** (`{colors.border-strong}` - `#c1c1c1`): Heavier stroke for disabled outline buttons and form input outlines after focus.

### Text

- **Ink** (`{colors.ink}` - `#222222`): Dominant text color on light surfaces. Use for display headlines, body paragraphs, primary nav links, and most inline link text. Never use pure black.
- **Body** (`{colors.body}` - `#3f3f3f`): Secondary running text color for long-form review and amenity copy.
- **Muted** (`{colors.muted}` - `#6a6a6a`): Subtitles, inactive tab labels, footer sub-labels, and secondary links.
- **Muted Soft** (`{colors.muted-soft}` - `#929292`): Disabled link text.
- **Star Rating** (`{colors.star-rating}` - `#222222`): Star icons and rating numbers. Do not use yellow or gold stars.
- **On Primary** (`{colors.on-primary}` - `#ffffff`): White text on Rausch CTAs.

### Semantic

- **Error** (`{colors.primary-error-text}` - `#c13515`): Inline error text for form validation.
- **Error Hover** (`{colors.primary-error-text-hover}` - `#b32505`): Darker error link hover.
- **Legal Link Blue** (`{colors.legal-link}` - `#428bff`): Inline links inside legal copy only.

### Scrim

- **Scrim** (`{colors.scrim}` - `#000000` at 50% opacity): Global modal backdrop tone.

## Typography

### Font Family

Use Airbnb Cereal VF for everything: display, body, navigation, captions, and microcopy. Fallbacks are `Circular, -apple-system, system-ui, Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", sans-serif`.

There is no separate display family. The variable font carries the entire scale.

### Hierarchy

| Token | Size | Weight | Line Height | Letter Spacing | Use |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `{typography.rating-display}` | 64px | 700 | 1.1 | -1px | Listing detail rating display |
| `{typography.display-xl}` | 28px | 700 | 1.43 | 0 | Homepage h1 |
| `{typography.display-lg}` | 22px | 500 | 1.18 | -0.44px | Listing detail h1 |
| `{typography.display-md}` | 21px | 700 | 1.43 | 0 | Section heads |
| `{typography.display-sm}` | 20px | 600 | 1.20 | -0.18px | Sub-section titles |
| `{typography.title-md}` | 16px | 600 | 1.25 | 0 | City link block titles |
| `{typography.title-sm}` | 16px | 500 | 1.25 | 0 | Footer column heads |
| `{typography.body-md}` | 16px | 400 | 1.5 | 0 | Default running text |
| `{typography.body-sm}` | 14px | 400 | 1.43 | 0 | Card meta, dates, prices |
| `{typography.caption}` | 14px | 500 | 1.29 | 0 | Search field segment labels |
| `{typography.caption-sm}` | 13px | 400 | 1.23 | 0 | Footer legal line |
| `{typography.badge}` | 11px | 600 | 1.18 | 0 | Guest favorite badge |
| `{typography.micro-label}` | 12px | 700 | 1.33 | 0 | Card amenity micro-labels |
| `{typography.uppercase-tag}` | 8px | 700 | 1.25 | 0.32px | NEW badges |
| `{typography.button-md}` | 16px | 500 | 1.25 | 0 | Primary CTA button labels |
| `{typography.button-sm}` | 14px | 500 | 1.29 | 0 | Pill button labels |
| `{typography.link}` | 14px | 400 | 1.43 | 0 | Inline body links |
| `{typography.nav-link}` | 16px | 600 | 1.25 | 0 | Top product-nav labels |

### Principles

Display weights stay modest. The homepage h1 at 28px / 700 is deliberately small. It tucks under the search bar so photography and the city-link grid carry visual hierarchy. The listing-detail h1 at 22px / 500 is even quieter; the listing photo banner does the work above it.

The single typographically loud moment is the rating display (`{typography.rating-display}` - 64px / 700) on listing pages.

### Note on Font Substitutes

If Airbnb Cereal VF and Circular are unavailable, Inter is the closest open-source substitute. Adjust display headlines down by about 2% in line-height to match Cereal's slightly tighter cap height.

## Layout

### Spacing System

- **Base unit:** 4px, with a 2px micro-step.
- **Tokens:** `{spacing.xxs}` 2px, `{spacing.xs}` 4px, `{spacing.sm}` 8px, `{spacing.md}` 12px, `{spacing.base}` 16px, `{spacing.lg}` 24px, `{spacing.xl}` 32px, `{spacing.xxl}` 48px, `{spacing.section}` 64px.
- **Section padding:** 64px for major page bands.
- **Card internal padding:** 24px for host and reservation cards; 16px for property-card meta; 8px for caption and date-row gutters.
- **Gutters:** 16px between cards in homepage grids; 24px inside footer columns; 4px on dense category-strip dividers.

### Grid & Container

- **Max content width:** about 1280px centered on homepage/editorial pages. Listing detail pages cap closer to 1080px.
- **City link grid:** 6 columns on desktop, each with city name and muted category sub-label.
- **Listing detail:** 2 columns with content on the left and sticky reservation card on the right.
- **Footer:** 3-column link list on desktop, collapsing to 1 column on mobile.

### Whitespace Philosophy

The system gives editorial bands 64px of vertical breathing room but compresses card grids. Property and city-link cards sit just 16px apart. The contrast is intentional: open hero, dense marketplace below.

## Elevation

The system has one shadow tier plus the flat baseline.

- **Flat:** Body, hero, footer, editorial bands, and most surfaces.
- **Card hover float:** `box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.02) 0 0 0 1px, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04) 0 2px 6px 0, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) 0 4px 8px 0`. Use on property cards, the search bar, and dropdown menus.
- **Modal scrim:** `{colors.scrim}` rendered at 50% opacity.

There are no progressive elevation tiers. The system either has the one shadow or none.

## Responsive Behavior

| Name | Width | Key Changes |
|---|---:|---|
| Mobile | <744px | Top nav collapses to logo plus hamburger; search bar becomes a single tappable pill; cards stack 1-up; reservation card becomes a sticky bottom bar. |
| Tablet | 744-1128px | Product tabs remain, search bar narrows, cards 2-up, city grid 2-3 columns. |
| Desktop | 1128-1440px | Full top nav, full segmented search pill, property cards 4-up, city grid 6 columns, listing detail 2 columns. |
| Wide | >1440px | Content width caps and gutters absorb the rest. |

### Touch Targets

- Primary CTAs are minimum 48px x 48px.
- Search orb is 48px x 48px circular.
- Heart save button is 32px x 32px circular with generous photo-card padding.
- Date-picker day cells are 40px x 40px circular.

### Collapsing Strategy

- Product tabs collapse into a hamburger sheet below 744px.
- Search bar's 3 segments collapse into a single-tap entry on mobile.
- Property and city-link grids reduce columns cleanly at each breakpoint.
- Reservation card switches from right rail to sticky bottom bar on mobile.

## Known Gaps

- Hover state colors are intentionally not documented beyond the subtle elevation lift.
- Loading states and skeleton screens are not captured.
- Map view styling is not captured.
- Full form input error-state combinations are not captured.
- Luxe and Plus sub-systems are scoped separately and not captured here.
